**Project Title**: Coffee Sales in New York

**Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- SQL (EDA, CTEs, Aggregations) 
- Python (EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Pivoting)
- Tableau

This projcet was designed to demostrate skills in Postgre SQL, Python and Tableau. The project involves the transformation of a Kaggle coffee sales dataset via SQL queries into a Python and Tableau readablke format in order to uncover insights from the sales data across 6 months and three different store locaitons. After transformaiton using SQL queries the data was loaded into python to perfrom EDA and manipulaiton from a wide format into a long format. It was then loaded into Tableau where an interactive dashboard was created. 

# Objectives 
- Demonstrate a strong basic skillset in data analytical techniques of data cleaning, transforming, EDA and SQL queries 
- Uncover underlying patterns in the coffee sales dataset
- Create a visually appealing Tableau dashboard to caputure only the most relevant information

# Scope
- The dataset contains fictitious data from 3 ficticious coffee shops across NYC
- The following findings will be presented as real insights as if the data was real 

# Key Findings 

- There is a general uptrend in sales for most porducts across all three locaitons
- No significant deviations between product sales across the three branches suggesting consistent markets for the same products/services across NYC, this also suggests that the quality   of the products offered across the 3 loactions does not deviate significantly to signify consumers distain for ordering specific products from specific locations
- Lower Manhattan appears to be the weakest performing branch in terms of tea and coffee sales (although this differentiation is minimal)
- Tracking syrup sales over time shows days without syrup sales across all branches. Indicating a significant issue with the supplier/order quantities of the syrups as there appears to be periods where no location has any to offer customers
- Merchandise sales appear lower in Hell's Kitchen region, perhaps signifiying a lower brand recognition in that area of New York
